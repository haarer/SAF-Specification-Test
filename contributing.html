<h1 id="how-to-contribute-to-saf">How To Contribute to SAF?</h1>

<p>The SAF Specification is published as markdown documentation in the SAF-Specification github repository.
It is generated from a model.</p>

<h2 id="reporting-issues">Reporting Issues</h2>

<p>Problems should be reported via github issue tracking. It should be stated what the problem is and a short solution should be suggested, ideally accompanied by a pull request.</p>

<h2 id="proposing-changes-pull-request">Proposing Changes (pull request)</h2>

<p>In general, changes should be proposed by forking the main branch of the SAF-Specification repository into a userâ€™s own repository and creating a pull request. This allows the proposed change to be discussed separately without interfering with the development of SAF and without being interfered with by the development of SAF. The pull request is checked, and if the changes are accepted, they are incorporated into the model. A newly created model specification can then be compared with the merged pull request and should be identical.</p>

<h2 id="proposing-new-viewpoints">Proposing new viewpoints</h2>

<p>For new viewpoints, the existing viewpoints should be reviewed first, as the concerns may already be covered. Only if a new viewpoint is required, an existing viewpoint should be used as a template and all required viewpoint specification attributes should be completed by the submitter. The procedure is the same as for a change request, but the change request must be supported by a conceptual model showing the relationships and the elements to be represented. This conceptual model must be discussed with the SAF architects and compared with the existing concepts.</p>

<h2 id="proposing-changes-or-viewpoints-using-github-discussions">Proposing Changes or Viewpoints using GitHub Discussions</h2>
<p>Changes may be proposed using the Discussions on the Specification Repository</p>

<h2 id="developing-saf">Developing SAF</h2>

<p>he development of the SAF viewpoints comprises several interlinked elements and concepts. How the SAF is developed is explained in more detail in this article <a href="developing-saf/development.md">SAF-Development</a>.</p>
