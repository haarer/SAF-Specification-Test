Note: The intention is to capture the expectations and to explicitly dissect the functionality. This must not be interpreted as an attempt for a behavior specification of an External Entity. Capturing this valuable information is the basis to reach agreement on the functionality at the System boundary by clarifying the expectations about what is performed by Context Elements.</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="../concepts.html#_19_0_2_26f0132_1562303524161_394471_91009">System Function</a></td><td>Specifies the fundamental action or task that have to take place in the System in accepting and processing the
inputs and in processing and generating the outputs.
A System Function
 * accepts input from the System boundary 
 * exposes its output at the System boundary
 * changes the System's State
 * is dependent on System's State
Note: A System Function does not need to expose observable output, when it changes the System's state in a way that is observable by other system functions. Furthermore, a System Function does not need to accept any input from the system boundary, when it is dependent on the System State, which in turn is changeable by other System Functions.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../concepts.html#_2021x_2_8710274_1675988365178_267674_34276">LETspecifyingAPE</a></td><td>Specifies the fact that one or more Logical Element specifies exactly one Physical Element. 
Rationale:
If more than one Physical Element would offer to realize the functionality specified by a Logical Element the responsibility would be ambiguous.
It is okay to assign several Logical Elements to one Physical Element. This means all specified functionality assigned to the Logical Elements is to be implemented by the Physical Element.

Note, that typically the usage of logical elements in a context is mapped to the usage of physical elements in a context (allocation of usage). Thus this relationship between the definitions is derived.</td></tr>
