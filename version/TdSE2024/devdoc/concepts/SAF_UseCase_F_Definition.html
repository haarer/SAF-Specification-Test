<tr><td><a href="../concepts.html#_19_0_4_26f0132_1624611972707_746294_1003">Context Function</a></td><td>Specifies the fact that a fundamental action or task is expected to be carried out by an External Entity. 
Note: The intention is to capture the expectations and to explicitly dissect the functionality. This must not be interpreted as an attempt for a behavior specification of an External Entity. Capturing this valuable information is the basis to reach agreement on the functionality at the System boundary by clarifying the expectations about what is performed by Context Elements.</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="../concepts.html#_19_0_1_26f0132_1554446894995_335285_45800">System Use Case</a></td><td>The System Use Cases are a table of content of the services provided by the System of Interest to its System Actors. A System Use Case is only the abstract of the depicted System behavior and represents the purpose. While the main System of Interest interaction actors participating in this Use Case are identified, the behavior itself is specified by a Use Case Activity, 
Note: The intended use (and also misuse in so called "black use cases") of the System of Interest is captured in free text; story telling at a coarse level of detail which is understandable to Customers (non engineering stakeholders in general).</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="../concepts.html#_19_0_2_26f0132_1562303524161_394471_91009">System Function</a></td><td>Specifies the fundamental action or task that have to take place in the System in accepting and processing the
inputs and in processing and generating the outputs.
A System Function
 * accepts input from the System boundary 
 * exposes its output at the System boundary
 * changes the System's State
 * is dependent on System's State
Note: A System Function does not need to expose observable output, when it changes the System's state in a way that is observable by other system functions. Furthermore, a System Function does not need to accept any input from the system boundary, when it is dependent on the System State, which in turn is changeable by other System Functions.</td></tr>
