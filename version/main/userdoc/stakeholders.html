<p>Definition - Acquirer:
Stakeholder that acquires or procures a product or service from a supplier, [ISO/IEC 15288:2022 - Systems engineering - System life-cycle processes]
The Acquirer is a Stakeholder that acquires or procures a product or service from a supplier. The Acquirer may be an organization or an individual acting on behalf of the customer or the user.
He is responsible for providing a feasible solution within a given budget. The Acquirer must plan and control the delivery of the system-of-interest as well as other systems together with necessary infrastructure, equipment or training. He must plan the integration of all the procured items to provide a complete solution ready for operation. For large enterprises standardization is an issue. Therefore, the acquirer is interested that standard items are considered in the system architecture.</p>

<h1 id="customer-representative">Customer (Representative)</h1>

<p>Definition - Customer (Representative):
(1) [SAF] The primary goal in a Customer (Representative) role is to represent the end-user, an individual, organization, or enterprise that benefits from the operation of the system. In this role the Customer (Representative) provides usage scenarios, user needs and requirements.
(2) [SAF] The secondary goal in a Customer (Representative) role is to represent the Acquirer, who buys or procures a product or service from a supplier. The Acquirer selected by the User to serve as their technical representative to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Specify the system.</li>
  <li>Select a System Developer or Services Provider.</li>
  <li>Provide technical assistance.</li>
  <li>Provide contractual oversight for the execution of the contract and delivery of a
verified and validated system to the User.
Note: All other Stakeholders do not use the system for purpose, and they do not need or require the system to satisfy any need. Therefore, interests of the end-user and claims of the other stakeholders could be contradicting and the Customer (Representative) role therefore strives for a solution satisfying all the Stakeholder Requirements.

<p>Definition - Operator:
Individual or organization that performs the operations of a system, [ISO/IEC 15288:2022 – Systems engineering - System life-cycle processes]
The Operator is an individual or organization that uses knowledge, skills and procedures to perform the functions of the system to provide the benefit, product or service. 
An individual Operator combined with knowledge, skills, and procedures may be considered as an element of the system. The role of the operator and the role of the user can be delegated to a single individual or may be simultaneously instantiated in the same organization. 
<em>For example: Air passengers are the user of the air transport system while a single flight is operated by an air carrier like the Lufthansa using aircrafts of various types to provide the transport service. 
To provide the service to the passengers the carrier’s organization must implement lots of services utilizing several other enabling systems. 
The individual aircraft is operated by the pilot who uses the on-board systems to control the aircraft and to navigate during that flight. 
The example illustrates, that the roles user and operator are depending heavily on the definition of the SOI Scope.</em></p>

<h1 id="security-expert">Security Expert</h1>

<p>Definition - Security Specialist:
Security is one subject matter of specialty engineering but important enough to be treated separately.
The IT-Security experts evaluate a proposed system architecture and design for IT-Security. One outcome of the activity are technical security requirements that need to be considered in the system design. Other outcomes affect the organization or the infrastructure of the user or define procedures that need to be implemented.</p>

<h1 id="user">User</h1>

<p>Definition - User:
Individual or group that interacts with a system or benefits from a system during its utilization, [ISO/IEC 15288:2022 - Systems engineering - System life-cycle processes]
The User is the individual, organization or group that benefits from the operation of the system. The User provides the usage scenarios, the User needs and finally the user requirements representing most of the functional requirements but also non-functional requirements. The role of User and the role of operator are sometimes allocated, simultaneously or sequentially, to the same individual or organization. All the other stakeholders do not use the system for any purpose, and they do not need or require the system to satisfy any need. Therefore, interests of the User and claims of the Stakeholder could be contradicting.</p>
