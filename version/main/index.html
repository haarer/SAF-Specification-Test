<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Inspired by the various enterprise architecture frameworks the System Architecture Framework (SAF) is a common, domain independent system architecture framework dedicated to support Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) of technical systems.</p>

<p>The SAF can be used stand-alone and also complementary to enterprise architecture frameworks. SAF starts where an enterprise architecture framework stops.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-saf">What is SAF?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>SAF is an architecture framework intended to support the Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) of technical systems.</li>
  <li>SAF is an open toolbox.</li>
  <li>SAF is based on a Systems Engineering Ontology and structured by viewpoint definitions.</li>
  <li>SAF starts where enterprise architecture frameworks end.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="saf-documentation">SAF Documentation</h1>

<p>This site contains both documentation for users of SAF and developers of SAF. To understand how to use SAF, head over to <strong><a href="using.md">Using SAF</a></strong>. To understand how we develop SAF, see <strong><a href="devdoc.md">Development Documentation</a></strong>. We always welcome contributions from our MBSE community to improve SAF, see <a href="contributing.md">how to contribute to SAF</a>.</p>

<h1 id="example">Example</h1>
<p>The System Architecture Framework Specification application is demonstrated using the <strong>Fire Forest Detection System (FFDS)</strong> example, courtesy of Tim Weilkiens. The Fire Forest Detection System example is based on the publication <strong>SYSMOD - The Systems Modeling Toolbox, 3rd edition Pragmatic MBSE with SysML, Tim Weilkiens</strong></p>

<h1 id="releases">Releases</h1>
<p>This documentation is for the main branch of SAF that reflects the current state of development and it is updated as required. See the <a href="CHANGES.md">change report</a> for an information about major changes.</p>

<p>The following SAF releases are available, each of which is managed in a separate branch:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/GfSE/SAF-Specification/tree/Initial-Release/README.md">Initial Release</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/GfSE/SAF-Specification/tree/TdSE2022/README.md">TdSE2022</a></li>
