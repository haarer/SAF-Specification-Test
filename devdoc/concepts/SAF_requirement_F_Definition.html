<tr><td><a href="../concepts.html#_19_0_1_26f0132_1554446894995_335285_45800">System Use Case</a></td><td>The System Use Cases are a table of content of the services provided by the System of Interest to its System Actors. A System Use Case is only the abstract of the depicted System behavior and represents the purpose. While the main System of Interest interaction actors participating in this Use Case are identified, the behavior itself is specified by a Use Case Activity, 
Note: The intended use (and also misuse in so called "black use cases") of the System of Interest is captured in free text; story telling at a coarse level of detail which is understandable to Customers (non engineering stakeholders in general).</td></tr>

Note: This is the relationship of requirements of different architectural levels. When the team responsible for the subsystem has direct access to the full upstream requirements set, then no subcontractor relationship needs to be established.</td></tr>

inputs and in processing and generating the outputs.
A System Function
 * accepts input from the System boundary 
 * exposes its output at the System boundary
 * changes the System's State
 * is dependent on System's State
Note: A System Function does not need to expose observable output, when it changes the System's state in a way that is observable by other system functions. Furthermore, a System Function does not need to accept any input from the system boundary, when it is dependent on the System State, which in turn is changeable by other System Functions.</td></tr>
