Goals are generally expressed using qualitative words; e.g., “increase”, “improve”, or “easier”. Goals can also be decomposed; e.g., “increase profit” can be decomposed into the Goals “reduce cost” and “increase sales”. However, it is also very common to associate concrete objectives with Goals, which can be used to describe both the quantitative and time-related measures which are essential to describe the desired state, and when it should be achieved.</td></tr>
